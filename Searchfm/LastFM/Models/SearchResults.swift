// MARK: - JSON Decoding -

/// Due to the search results JSON having some keys being quite nested
/// and some even having keys that are dynamic based on the entity type
/// that is being searched we have to jump through a few hoops to parse
/// the `SearchResults` model, especially if we want to continue to use
/// it as a generic type in order to reduce repetition.
///
/// From what I could see, the JSON is structured in this way due to
/// conformance to the OpenSearch API standard. An alternative would've
/// been to use a library which already conforms to this standard and
/// provides the client functionality in Swift, however in the limited
/// time available for this assignment I could not find a library that
/// seemed reliable enough to base this implementation on, hence the
/// custom approach below.

/// In the code below we define an enum, `SearchType`, which
/// describes the different searchable entities that are
/// supported. The actual type of the search is then inferred
/// from the generic type of `SearchResults.CodingKeys` and
/// mapped to the correct enum inside the `searchType` property.
/// Finally, the `rawValue` of `SearchType` is interpolated into
/// the key name for the keys that require it.
///
/// This means that whenever new search types need to be
/// supported, the `SearchType` enum needs to
/// be updated to include the new type, and the `searchType`
/// variable must be updated in order to map the generic type
/// to the appropriate `SearchType` so that key names can be
/// parsed correctly.
///
/// The code responsible for mapping the generic type to
/// a `SearchType` below triggeres a `fatalError` if the
/// mapping fails. This is due to the fact that such a
/// failure would be considered a programming error that
/// needs to be caught at debug time, hence the need to
/// bring this to the attention of the developer.
